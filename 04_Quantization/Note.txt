###### Quantization
Sample/Hold :
Converts independent
Variable from continuous
To discrete

Quantizer :
Converts dependent variable from continious
To discrete

###### Sample Theorem
* Analog Filters
  ^ Bessel (IIR)
  ^ Chebyshev
  ^ Butterworth

* Low Pass Filters
* High Pass Filters
* Sallen-Key Filters

$ Step Response = Filter response to rapid imput value change.

###### Information Encoding
$ Frequency domain = Information is encoded in sine waves of signal.
$ Time domain = Information is encoded in shape of waveform.

###### Linear Systems & Surperposition
$ Continuous signal : x(t), y(t)
$ Discrete signal : x[t], y[t]

$ Linear System has three properties :
  ^ Homogeneity (x[t] -> system -> y[t]) === (kx[t] -> system -> ky[t])
  ^ Additivity  (x1[t] -> system -> y1[t]) + (x2[t] -> system -> y2[t]) === (x1[t] + x2[t] -> system -> y1[t] + y2[t])
  ^ Shift invariance (x[t] -> system -> y[t]) === (x[t + s] -> system -> y[t + s])

$ Synthesis : Combining signals through scaling and addition.
$ Decomposition : Breaking a signal into additive components.

$ Impulse Decomposition : Breaking a signal into additive components. But N number of samples
  signal  into N components signal.
$ Step Decomposition : ???
